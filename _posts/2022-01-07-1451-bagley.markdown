### Building on Success at Bagley & Trumbull 

![Folk](/images/folk.jpeg "Folk")

The project is located in Corktown at the intersection of Bagley St. and Trumbull Ave. where over the past decade we have successfully renovated two historic structures and developed a new infill building transforming the corner across the street from the project site into a lively retail, residential and neighborhood hub.

### Fees / Promote Structure
* Given the new product type for us with the small office suites, we've decided to not take any upfront development fees on this deal to demonstrate incentive alignment
* The promote structure would be a 70/30 limited partner (LP)/general partner (GP) profit split up to a 15% IRR, 60/40 above a 15%, and 50/50 above a 20% (for capital events, 100% of the capital would go to LPs until their initial capital is repaid before the profit split kicks in)	

### Organizational Chart

![Organizational Chart](/images/org-chart.png)

## Summary Return Projections

* Refinance the project two years after stabilization
* Hold the building for 10+ years to take advantage of Opportunity Zone benefits
