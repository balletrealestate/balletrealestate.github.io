* **Location**:  [1451 Bagley, Detroit, MI](https://goo.gl/maps/bGCL7dq9d6Ya1k3bA)

* **Business Plan**:
  * Redevelop the existing 3,000 SF building and add a 2,000 SF addition
  * Subdivide into 4 small retail bays on the 1st floor and 11 private office suites on the 2nd floor
  * Take advantage of changing work trends by marketing affordable private offices toward local "remote-eligible" workers and small business owners looking for office space close to home

* **Partner**: [Inkwell Partners LLC](https://www.inkwelldev.com/) // Devon Caldwell and Ryan Zampardo
	* Inkwell Partners has successfully acquired and developed high-quality properties at attainable price points throughout Detroit
    * Their disciplined approach allows them to effectively manage risk while providing long term growth for investors and neighbors alike
	* Ballet already owns the building at 1451 Bagley and we were interested in finding a partner to assist with financing and developing the site, which is how Inkwell came to be involved
	* Inkwell and Ballet would purchase the building via a new company and Ballet would remain a sponsor alongside Inkwell

* **Capital Structure**:
	* We plan to raise the entire $1.45m via Opportunity Zone equity (or other non-OZ equity looking to ride alongside the OZ business plan)
	* Refinance the project a couple years later upon stabilization
	* Hold the building for 10+ years to take advantage of Opportunity Zone benefits

* **Fees / Promote Structure**:
	* Given the new product type for us with the small office suites, we've decided to not take any upfront development fees on this deal to demonstrate incentive alignment
	* The promote structure would be a 70/30 limited partner (LP)/general partner (GP) profit split up to a 15% IRR, 60/40 above a 15%, and 50/50 above a 20% (for capital events, 100% of the capital would go to LPs until their initial capital is repaid before the profit split kicks in)
	
* **Opportunity Zone Eligibility**:
	* We plan to set up the entities in 2021 so that anyone with 2021 capital gains has the opportunity to take advantage of this year's Opportunity Zone benefits
	* Closing will take place in Q1 2022, so 2022 capital gains will also be eligible
